#### Sprint 2
In this sprint we are going to leverage our cleaned data and apply unsupervised machine learning algorithims to segment podcast listeners

#### Summary:
I discovered that there are 3 segments of podcast listeners.
1. First segment is: 
    a. 60% men & 40% female.
    b. 60% of podcast listenrs reside in either Ontario or British Columbia.
    c. Top podcast category listen to is Comedy and News & Politics.
    d. Top average age is about 30 years old, with 50 years old coming next.
    
2. Second Segmen is:
    a. 60% men & 40% female.
    b. 60% of podcast listenrs reside in either Ontario or Quebec.
    c. They listen equally to most type of categories.
    d. Average age is between 30 to 50 years old.

3. Third cluster is:
    a. 60% men & 40% female.
    b. 60% of podcast listenrs reside in either Ontario or Quebec.
    c. They listen equally to most type of categories.
    d. Average age is above 50-60 years old.op columns.

#### Files:
Please find Sprint2.pynb within Sprint2 Folder which will contain detailed summary and the code used to apply modeling algorithim.

#### Result:
We were able to produce meanigfull insights. Please refer to analysis conclusion within Sprint2.pynb within Sprint2 Folder.

#### What is next:
1. Next steps is to experiment encoding the entire categorical data set and apply PCA then Kmeans.
2. Improve visualizations.
3. Potential web deployment to ad agency so they can determine what category they should advertise on based on input parameters by them such as age, gender, income, etc.
