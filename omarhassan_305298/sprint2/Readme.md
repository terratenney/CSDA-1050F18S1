#### Sprint 2
In this sprint we are going to leverage our cleaned data and apply unsupervised machine learning algorithims to segment podcast listeners

#### Summary:
I discovered that there are 3 segments of podcast listeners.
1. First segment is: 
We can tell that cluster one is characterized by Young age, male dominant and their top listening category is Comedy and they mostly live in Ontario and British Columbia and their average top income is 67K per year.
    
2. Second Segment is:
As for Cluster two it is characterized by older age listeners in which it is mostly composed of listeners who are 60 years old or above. They mostly reside in Ontario and Quebec they are male dominant. Their top category they listen to is News/Politics and Society/Culture and they are characterized by high income.

3. Third Segment is:
As for cluster three it is characterized by Young again but it is very female dominant. They mostly reside in Quebec and their top listening category is Comedy similar to Cluster one.
    

#### Files:
Please find Sprint2.pynb within Sprint2 Folder which will contain detailed summary and the code used to apply modeling algorithim.

#### Result:
We were able to produce meanigfull insights. Please refer to analysis conclusion within Sprint2.pynb within Sprint2 Folder.

#### What is next:
1. Next steps is to experiment encoding the entire categorical data set and apply PCA then Kmeans.
2. Improve visualizations.
3. Potential web deployment to ad agency so they can determine what category they should advertise on based on input parameters by them such as age, gender, income, etc.
