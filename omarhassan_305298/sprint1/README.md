### Sprint 1
In this sprint we are going to be focusing on exploring our data, conducting data cleaning and getting data to be more readable and ready for exploration.

### Summary
Upon first exploring the data we found that data headers need to be mapped to a dictionary. This was challenging as our raw data set is composed of over 500 columns. So, we had to figure out a way to map both data sets with a function. We used a mapping function to rename all the columns on our raw data set so column names would become more readable. Second, as we mentioned above, the data is composed of over 500 columns, so we had to do some understanding of the data set and drop columns.

### Files
Please find Sprint 1.pynb within Sprin1 Folder which will contain detailed suppary and the code used to map and clean the data.

### Result
1. We were able to map columns to a more meanigfull headers.
2. We were able to reduce number of columns from over 500 down to 184

### Whats next

We are going to continue our data cleaning, explore data using some visualization techniques.
